## Unreal Engine Projects

- **Description**: Developed a VR bathroom configurator using Unreal Engine that allows users to customize materials and styles in real-time. This project is currently used in multiple stores to enhance customer engagement.
- **Features**: The VR bathroom configurator has two main components: the showroom and the configurator.
  - **Showroom**: Features multiple pre-made rooms, each with its own pricing, providing customers with an overview of available options.
  - **Configurator**: Allows users to modify the finishes of every piece of furniture in the bathroom, with prices updating live. Users can then submit their email to receive detailed pricing information and a photo of their configured bathroom.
- **Usage**: This software is currently being used in company offices to help clients visualize and understand the products they are purchasing.
- **Note**: Unfortunately, I cannot share the code due to an NDA.

### Unreal Engine Robot Simulator

- **Description**: Created a simulator in Unreal Engine to remotely test robot movements for the RoboCup Junior competition. The simulator enabled testing of over 100 maze configurations. For further details,Â  visit the repository to learn more about the project.

- **Description**: Designed and built a fully playable forest level, focusing on atmosphere and environment. This was one of my first projects, aimed at learning and understanding the fundamentals of Unreal Engine. The level is fully playable, and my primary goal was to achieve photorealism. I utilized the Quixel Library with Megascans to create a believable environment.
